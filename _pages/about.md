I am a PhD graduate from the University of Bristol (Compass CDT) specialising in statistical machine learning. I have published papers at multiple top conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS) and received a best paper award at ICML 2025. I am interested in developing theoretically grounded methods with strong practical performance, and am currently seeking quantitative research roles in industry or applied research settings. My research spans a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning problems including:
* score matching
* modelling with missing data
* density ratio estimation
* Neyman–Pearson classification
