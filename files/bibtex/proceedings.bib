  abstract = 	 {Density Ratio Estimation (DRE) is an important machine learning technique with many downstream applications. We consider the challenge of DRE with missing not at random (MNAR) data. In this setting, we show that using standard DRE methods leads to biased results while our proposal (M-KLIEP), an adaptation of the popular DRE procedure KLIEP, restores consistency. Moreover, we provide finite sample estimation error bounds for M-KLIEP, which demonstrate minimax optimality with respect to both sample size and worst-case missingness. We then adapt an important downstream application of DRE, Neyman-Pearson (NP) classification, to this MNAR setting. Our procedure both controls Type I error and achieves high power, with high probability. Finally, we demonstrate promising empirical performance both synthetic data and real-world data with simulated missingness.}

    abstract={Conditional quantile treatment effect (CQTE) can provide insight into the effect of a treatment beyond
    the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). This ability to provide information over
    multiple quantiles of the response makes CQTE especially valuable in cases where the effect of
    a treatment is not well-modelled by a location shift, even conditionally on the covariates. Nevertheless,
    the estimation of CQTE is challenging and often depends upon the smoothness of the individual quantiles as a
    function of the covariates rather than smoothness of the CQTE itself. This is in stark contrast to CATE
    where it is possible to obtain high-quality estimates which have less dependency upon the smoothness of
    the nuisance parameters when the CATE itself is smooth. Moreover, relative smoothness of the CQTE lacks the
    interpretability of smoothness of the CATE making it less clear whether it is a reasonable assumption
    to make. We combine the desirable properties of CATE and CQTE by considering a new estimand, the conditional
    quantile comparator (CQC). The CQC not only retains information about the whole treatment distribution, similar to
    CQTE, but also having more natural examples of smoothness and is able to leverage simplicity in an auxiliary
    estimand. We provide finite sample bounds on the error of our estimator, demonstrating its ability to exploit
    simplicity. We validate our theory in numerical simulations which show that our method produces more accurate
    estimates than baselines. Finally, we apply our methodology to a study on the effect of employment incentives
    on earnings across different age groups. We see that our method is able to reveal heterogeneity of the effect
    across different quantiles.}
